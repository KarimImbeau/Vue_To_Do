# Simple To-Do List

This is a **simple to-do list** project that I created to practice my skills with Vue.js. Itâ€™s a basic application that helps users manage their daily tasks easily and efficiently.

## Project Setup

To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server

To compile the project and enable hot-reloading for development, use the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy the app, run this command to compile and minify the code for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Linting and Fixing Files

You can also run the linter to check for errors and automatically fix them:

```bash
npm run lint
```
